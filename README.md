# Hi,
my name is **lasermtv07** aka Michal Chmelar. I am 16 and live in the Czech republic and study on an unspecified technical high school.
I use Debian GNU/Linux and I am supported of the *Free/Libre* software movement - though I haven't gone fully *libre* yet. I like the PHP programming language.
I also like the concept of **[esoteric programming languages](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Main_Page)**. (Written a few myself and also wrote a simple [brainfuck program](https://github.com/lasermtv07/brainfuck-uwufier)).
In the last month or so, I became interested in topics such as **information theory**, though I struggle with it as math is hard. I'm also trying to improve in that low-level digital logic, designing my first circuits.

I often watch creepypastas (I like having them in the background, one of my favourite [Czech channels](https://invidious.fdn.fr/channel/UCHKTgY-N2kroEpNNXkjIW7g)), the backrooms (my favourite level is the [level Ï†](https://backrooms.fandom.com/wiki/Level_Phi)).
I also sometimes read about SCP etc. (you could guess my favourite is [SCP-079](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-079)). I sometimes read sci fi and fantasy books, since I found this genre interesting.
Even because of this, people dont believe me I havent read those most ones (like Hobit or Witcher). I like more niche books. Ill put links for some good ones later in this description. A particularly interesting genre is LitRPG,
which is like game lets plays but its a book and has actual story and character development unlike some of those youtube brainrots. I dont watch films very often, but one of my favourite series was **Gravity Falls**. I also watched
the SteinsGate movie but I wasnt able to find the full series for a download :(

I also exist.
